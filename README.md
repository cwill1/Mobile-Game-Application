1. The game is played on an iOS device in the face-up
position. The player uses the accelerometer to
control the movement of the ball (the white ball in
the sample screen). Imagine the ball is being placed
in a rectangular box with smooth surfaces and solid
walls on all four sides, like a billiard table with no
pockets.
• The ball will be still if the device is perfectly
level and no other force is applied.
• The ball can be moved by slightly tilting the
device, as if you were tilting the box. The
velocity and movement of the ball should mimic
the effects caused by the gravity when the surface is slightly tilted.
• When the ball hits any of the four sides, it bounces back like a billiard ball hits the
sides of a billiard table.
• You can also hit the ball with a quick, short stroke of the device, mimicking hitting
a billiard ball. The ball moves in the direction of the force applied by the
user. The acceleration and velocity of the ball mimics the effect of the force
applied by the user, i.e., affected by the magnitude of the force. The ball would
accelerate first, and then gradually deaccelerate.

2. It is not necessary to have the physics of the ball movement to be exact. Some close
approximation of the real effect would be sufficient. 

3. There are various static and moving objects in the playing field. Some are prizes (e.g.,
the green squares in the sample screen) and some are hazards. When the ball makes contact with a prize object, the player earnspoints or rewards, and when the ball makes contact with a hazard object, the player
loses points or incur penalties. The prize and hazard objects enter the playing field in a
random fashion. However, after they appear the playing field, they either remain
stationary or move in a predictable manner. The prize and hazard points can be
amplified if the contact is made by hitting the ball rather than tilting the device.
4. There is a point system. Score high and win the game.
